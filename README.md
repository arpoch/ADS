### Pathway for learning Algorithms and Data-Structures

#### Basics
1. Familiarise with language
   * Do Basic Ad-hoc problems use Hackerrank (preferred) or CodeChef DSA Series
    
2. Start with Basic Mathematics problems[Hackerrank]
   
3. Learn about time and space complexity expect for recursion
   * Summations and Bounding Summations

4. Learn about Basic data-structures, and the build-libraries the language provide
    1. Arrays               2 Questions
    2. String               2 Questions
    3. Linked List          2 Questions
    4. Stack
    5. Queue                2 Questions
    
_Start with EASY problems on Leetcode for the learned DS_

5. Linear and Logarithmic algorithms(no-recursion)
    1. Sorting:
       1. In-place sorting:
       * Insertion Sort
       * Selection Sort
       * Bubble Sort
    2. Searching:
       1. Linear Search:
       2. Logarithmic Search:

6. Recursion starts
   * Basics
     * [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggk7HbcnLG8&list=PLBlnK6fEyqRjTO_UNGKuaaoxEqvSF0t5h&index=2)
       
   * Time and space complexity

#### Algorithmic Approach
7. Divide & Conquer
8. Greedy
9. Dynamic Programming
